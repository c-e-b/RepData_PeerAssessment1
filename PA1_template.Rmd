## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata/data/activity.zip"
download.file(fileUrl, destfile="./RepResActivity.zip")
unzip("RepResActivity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
# str(activity) # just to look at the data structure
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = activity, aes(x=date, y=steps)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
# notice warning about missing values - we are going to take care of that later
```



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
